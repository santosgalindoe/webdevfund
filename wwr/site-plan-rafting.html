    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our mission is to provide an easy way to plan an outdoor white water rafting experience like no other. Here in Idaho there is an abundance of outdoor scenery and activities to explore. We know all the great spots, and all the great places to dine at after a long day outdoors. As an honorary member of the Idaho outdoor community we also like to support our local outdoor businesses. We do this by creating great bundle deals whenever you decide to plan a white water rafting trip with us; that include activities such as dirt biking, hot springs, off roading, hunting and much more. If you plan on more than one day don't sweat it because we have great deals that are honored by only the best hotels near your next great white water rafting adventure and if you need something more cozy we also have great access to reviews on the best Airbnb's near your next trip with us.</p>
